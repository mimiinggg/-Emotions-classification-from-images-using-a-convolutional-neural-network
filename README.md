# -Emotions-classification-from-images-using-a-convolutional-neural-network
Develop a complete cognitive computing system in Python that can classify the emotion that a person is experiencing based on a photograph of the personâ€™s face using convolutional neural network model (CNN).

Prepared data for a neural network, including tasks like encoding labels and reshaping data for the CNN input.

Implemented various CNN architectures using Keras, including understanding layers like Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, BatchNormalization, Activation, Flatten, and Dense.

Trained neural network models, including specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics and use accuracy rate to identify the best model for running the classification.
